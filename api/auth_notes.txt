The way that this works for sign up:
1. Client sends uname, email, & pwd OVER HTTPS
2. we salt & hash pwd and store in creds, which only holds creds

For Sign In (Done through OAuth2):
1. Client sends uname, pwd, & permissions through headers
2. Server Calculates & Stores Session ID In RAM (Token)
3. Server Sends Back Session ID (Token)

For Auth (Using Token):
Client keeps sending token in header

You know, we could've done this without OAuth2, but this was easier
